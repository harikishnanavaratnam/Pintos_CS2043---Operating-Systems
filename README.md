# CS 2043 - Operating Systems Projects

## Overview

This repository contains the project submissions for the CS 2043 Operating Systems course. The projects focus on implementing and extending features of a simple educational operating system. The projects are designed to help students gain practical experience with low-level system programming, threading, synchronization, and process management.

### Projects

1. **Project 1: Threads**
   - **Description:** Implementation of various threading functionalities, including an alarm clock, priority scheduling, and synchronization mechanisms.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Alarm Clock: Threads can sleep for a specified number of ticks.
     - Priority Scheduling: Ensuring that the highest-priority thread is selected to run.
     - Synchronization: Avoiding race conditions when multiple threads interact.

2. **Project 2: User Programs**
   - **Description:** Implementation of features related to running and managing user programs, including argument passing and system calls.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Argument Passing: Parsing and passing command-line arguments to user programs.
     - System Calls: Implementation of system calls like `exec`, `wait`, `read`, `write`, and `exit`.
     - File Descriptors: Managing open files using file descriptors.
